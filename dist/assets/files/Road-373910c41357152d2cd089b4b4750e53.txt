A Strongly Worded Letter for the Road
---

Appreciation is sometimes easy to come by, and other times not. Whichever part of
that cycle you find yourself in at the moment, I hope you can handle just a few
more paragraphs' worth.

It would have been very special to have met you during some time when the world
didn't feel like it was falling apart, and in person. Thanks to your excitement,
compassion, conscientiousness, and willingness however, it's hard to say I feel
like I missed out -- if anything I feel very lucky. Lucky to live in a time where
such a thing is possible from so far apart, and lucky that it felt so reciprocal.

Once, you pointed out from a podcast I recommended what a cool thing it is to be
able to draw inspiration from what others are willing to share, and how consequential
that inspiration can be. Listening to the podcast myself, it wasn't something I
had paid much attention to at the time. However, the fact that it stuck out to you,
that you then shared it with me, and that it sticks with me to this day asserts how
true it is, and I think that's frickin awesome. So awesome to me that it
immediately made me want to incorporate it into my life, and feel comfortable
sharing random weird thoughts/scribbles with you.

Scribbling and poem-ing is something I'm very indecisive about, as in I'm unsure
why I do it, if it's any good, or even if I can take any credit for the words that
pass through my brain onto a computer screen. Yet despite all that, I enjoy your
appreciation of them, and am comforted by that passage in dhalgren where Ernest
Newboy speaks about experiencing pretty much all of those same thoughts himself. So
thank you for your appreciation, and for creating that mental bond between me
and this character. He may be fictional, but is certainly based on something real,
and this makes me feel less alone.

In hindsight, I was also very indecisive about getting one of your Christmas
packages. Money was never the determining factor, instead it was my internal
struggle at whether the fact that I would be buying a gift for myself would
completely change its nature, to the point where it wouldn't feel like a gift.
What gives me some regret, if anything, is not that I didn't buy it, but that it
feels like I froze up and never admitted to how I felt. A weird me thing, if
there ever was one, but I'm going to selfishly take up an entire paragraph as
an opportunity to own up to it because I can.

Fortunately and undeservedly, I ended up getting one anyway, so...
best of both worlds?

Our odd lasting bond in the time of covid (which you surely already know I mean
odd in the best way) has brought so many good vibes, such great tunes, and very
happy memories. It may or may not be a surprise, then that this bond has inspired me
to make such bonds more accessible to those who need them most. And I don't doubt
for a second, you will continue to be a super-spreader of all these soul-hugging
gems to the new friends you make along your way. It's been very cool to see you
find your place and mold it in an online community, all the while gaining
confidence, overcoming fear, and still being impressively careful.

From me, I can think of no thing better to end on than to acknowledge how open you
are and maybe also have become. I know I said this before, to some extent, in my
Thanksgiving message, but since then I feel I've expanded my own view of just what
I meant by it. There's a lot of overlap between the openness and conscientiousness
aspects, as your engagement with meaningful topics that others would habitually shy
away from demonstrates. Nobody comes into this by accident, and I'm not so sure
most people are even predisposed to notice it; I am endlessly impressed by it.
Also previously mentioned in another message was your openness to accepting help,
which is a combination of accepting others for their strengths and loving yourself
even with your weaknesses. Lastly (probably unfairly since openness can mean so many
more things, but in this context anyway), your openness to sexuality which is
simultaneously more vulnerable but also more overlapping with everything above.

A part of me wants to warn you and prevent you from succumbing to the risk of
others taking advantage of the fact that you've created a space where you feel
safe even though the internet, as an engineered construct, is inherently unsafe
and non-private. As humans longing for peace and convenience, this is hard for
us to accept in many ways. Yet another part of me feels that you're already very
much aware, and everything you've done up to this point in terms of taking
precautions makes me feel like I shouldn't worry at all because you're more
than capable of making these decisions. So maybe for purely selfish reasons,
I'll say, just to say that I did say it, trust yourself and don't let yourself
be pressured into unnecessarily public and risky situations. With technological
advancements, it's not so much a risk as a guarantee that bots managed by people
who don't know or care about you will record regardless of whether they have
any right to.

In case it does happen, I want to reassure you that you'll be ok. You'll get
through it because you're intelligent emotionally and equally resourceful.
Because among your other skills is attracting a solid support structure.
And also because... life is so much larger and has so much more potential
for healing than we give it credit for when we find ourselves in a dark tunnel.

Much like dhalgren, I could probably have condensed this down to a tenth as
many words and retained 95% of its meaning. Perhaps also like dhalgren, though,
that last 5% holds the key to something important, and I hope that's the case.
While I'm terrified of what's to come for me, if I'll be able to stay out of
trouble (without losing myself along the way), or if I'm even up to the task
I've set for myself, there are always things and moments that give me hope.
One being this adorable fucking meme:



And another being the map stored in my brain that holds everything I wrote
here about you. Feeling as though I'm entering a small death, I'm deeply
tempted to map us onto Le Petit Prince in some way, but maybe the best
thing about that book is that of all the characters in it, we are each
comprised of several of them. Just another thing (as if showing us the
importance of being curious & excited wasn't enough) that makes it beautiful.
Instead, I'll end with something simple: I love you. I'll miss you.
